# Customer-Loyalty-for-a-Subscription-Based-Platform-Dashboard

Based on the "Customer Loyalty for a Subscription-Based Platform Dashboard," several insights and conclusions can be drawn:

Unique Customers and Number of Subscriptions: The analysis reveals that the platform has 187 unique customers 
who have made a total of 841 subscriptions. 
The average number of subscriptions per customer is 4.

Subscription Refunds: Only one subscription was refunded, indicating a low level of customer dissatisfaction with purchases.

Subscriptions Over Time: The chart showing subscriptions over time indicates the highest growth in subscriptions 
occurred in September 2024 (125 subscriptions), followed by another high in October 2024 (117 subscriptions). 
This may suggest periodic promotions or increased interest in the platform's offerings during these months.

Month-over-Month Subscriber Growth (MOM): The MOM analysis shows that positive growth was only observed in May 2024 (+4.17%). 
Other months experienced a decline, highlighting the need for better customer retention strategies or optimized marketing efforts.

Customer Loyalty: The highest percentage of loyal customers, who subscribed for multiple months, 
is seen during the first two months of their subscription. The steepest drop in loyalty occurs after the second month, 
which may indicate challenges in engaging customers over the long term. Notably, 46.52% of cancellations occur after two months of subscription.

Average Number of Subscriptions: On average, each customer makes 4 subscriptions, 
which is a promising indicator of customer attachment to the platform but suggests room for improvement, 
especially with customers who cancel after a few months.

Analysis Scope: The analysis focuses exclusively on customers who made more than one subscription. 
Customers with only a single subscription were excluded, as they are not relevant for loyalty analysis. 
Both monthly and annual subscriptions were included in the data.

Challenges: The main challenge appears to be improving customer retention after the first two months of subscription. 
Actions such as personalized offerings, loyalty programs, or more effective reminders of the platform's value could be beneficial.

Recommendations: It is crucial to understand the reasons behind subscription cancellations 
after the initial months and develop strategies to retain customers, particularly during critical periods.
